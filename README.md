### Hello world!

I am an electrical engineering student at the Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) with a passion for innovation and creating projects involving electronics, the Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, programming, and mechanical design. I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow in my field. My diverse skill set allows me to approach projects from multiple angles, and I am confident in my ability to think critically and solve problems. I enjoy collaborating with others to bring new ideas to life, and I am excited to see where my interests and skills will take me next. In my free time, you can find me tinkering with new technologies or working on personal projects, and I am eager to make a positive impact in the world of engineering.

"One day I dream of waking up to the sound of machines humming, walking into my workshop filled with cutting-edge CNC machines, lathes, 3D printers, soldering station, and oscilloscopes, all paired with fancy computers, as I bring to life the projects I have thoughtfully crafted all night long. I will be the happiest man in the universe, as I turn my thoughts into creations."
